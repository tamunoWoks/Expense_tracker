# Expense_tracker
This is an Expense Tracker App, a web application designed to help users manage their daily expenses. It allows users to add, view, and delete expenses, while dynamically calculating the total amount spent.

Key features of the app include:
- Expense Management: Users can input a description and amount for each expense, which is then saved and displayed in a list.
- Dynamic Updates: The total expense is updated in real-time as expenses are added or removed.
- Interactive UI: A simple and user-friendly interface built with HTML and styled with CSS, while JavaScript is used to dynamically interact with the data.
- Backend Integration: The app uses a Flask backend that stores expenses in a SQLite database and exposes APIs to manage expense data (add, retrieve, delete).
- Full Stack: This app showcases a full-stack development approach, combining front-end and back-end technologies.
